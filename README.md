# MLAPI Shared Samples

The aim of this repository is to represent a collection of mini sample projects/games that showcase different 
sub-features of [MLAPI](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi) 
as well as being used for [Documentation](https://docs-multiplayer-sandbox.unity3d.com/docs/getting-started/about-mlapi) purposes.

## Who is this for?

This repo is mainly targeting Unity developers that want to get started with development of a multiplayer 
project using [MLAPI](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi)
that just got past the "Hello World" stage and are interesting in how they can use some specific sub-features of [MLAPI](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi)  in a more self-contained scenario.

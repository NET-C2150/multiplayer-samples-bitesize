# Client Driven

This is a sample project oriented to Client Driven behaviour using Netcode for GameObjects. In this sample you will learn more about Client driven movements, networked physics, spawning vs statically placed objects, object reparenting

## Sample feature

Making movements feel responsive while staying consistent over multiple game executables is a challenge for many networked games. ClientDriven's aim is to create a quick sample to show responsive character movements that don't feel sluggish, even under bad network conditions.
It also provides a client side object detection with server side pickup, showing client driven patterns and networked object reparenting.
These physics objects are spawned server side at regular intervals and can be pushed around by client driven players.

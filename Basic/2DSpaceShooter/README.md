## 2D Space Shooter

This is a UNet sample project converted to Unity MLAPI.

## Sample Features

This sample shows you:

- Server authorative physics based movement
- Managing health and a list of buffs for your players in a multiplayer game
- How to pool network objects such as bullets and asteroids to improve performance

## Future Work

- Player should spawn at random position instead of center of the map.
- Add a way to assign a player name to each player.
- NetworkTransform + Rigidbody is really jittery.
